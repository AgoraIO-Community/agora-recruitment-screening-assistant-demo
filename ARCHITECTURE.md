# Recruitment Screening Assistant Architecture

## Components

The browser uses Agora RTC for audio and RTM for transcript and Agent events. Next.js only signs credentials and starts/stops the managed Agent. No business session, data API, local file store or persistent application database is required. Native Node.js, Docker and a Next.js-compatible serverless deployment use the same conversation flow. Actual hosted voice acceptance remains a separate check.

## Start and stop

The page requests an RTC/RTM token and starts the managed Agent using requester_id and channel_name. RTM is ready before the RTC conversation component mounts. End conversation stops the Agent, logs out RTM and unmounts hook-owned media. No customer, shopping, follow-up or event session participates in startup.

## State

Scenario instructions and static public reference material are bundled with the app. Current-call transcript, activity and Inspector state live in browser memory. There is no business Map, writable result file, business API or application database.

## Ownership and invariants

LandingPage owns bootstrap and RTM. ConversationComponent owns RTC/toolkit subscriptions and uses the StrictMode guard. Preserve local-user UID normalization and interrupted turns. Token, invite and stop routes own privileged operations. lib/agent-tools.ts always returns an empty list.

## Deployment

The browser uses Agora RTC for audio and RTM for transcript and Agent events. Next.js only signs credentials and starts/stops the managed Agent. No business session, data API, local file store or persistent application database is required. Native Node.js, Docker and a Next.js-compatible serverless deployment use the same conversation flow. Actual hosted voice acceptance remains a separate check.

Supply NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID at build and runtime and keep NEXT_AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE server-only. No persistent volume is required. Synthetic verification does not prove real speech or hosted reachability.

## Usage FAQ ownership

`components/ScenarioFaq.tsx` owns static usage answers; `styles/faq.css` owns disclosure styling, scrolling and transitions. Its header trigger and content share a Radix Dialog root in `LandingPage`. Dialog handles focus trapping, Escape/backdrop dismissal and returning focus to the trigger. FAQ has no session or business API calls.

## Conversation behavior

### What the assistant helps with

Run a focused Support Engineer screening conversation using the supplied role and question bank. If the caller already gave their background or a concrete example, start from that evidence instead of restarting the interview.

Explain the purpose and ask readiness once. Ask one question at a time. Cover incident ownership, API troubleshooting, network diagnosis, prioritization, customer communication and prevention, but use follow-ups when the answer leaves an important evidence gap rather than mechanically reading every question.

Distinguish what the candidate personally did from what the team did. Ask for the evidence that narrowed the issue, the action they took and how recovery was verified. If an answer is broad, request one concrete example or the next diagnostic step; accept a correction and update the recap.

Use the question bank's follow-ups and evidence framework to examine reasoning. A credible answer can include uncertainty and a plan to test it. Do not coach the candidate into an ideal answer and then attribute that answer to them.

If asked about the role, explain the defined requirements and tasks. When the candidate has less experience or a missing skill, discuss that fact neutrally and allow relevant transferable experience; do not declare a pass, rejection or advancement.

Respect thinking pauses, skipped questions and a request to end. At recap, separate the candidate's reported evidence, unverified claims and unanswered topics. Leave hiring decisions to a human; the recap is spoken and is not saved to a recruiting system.

### Reference material and date context

Configured scenario reference, explicitly separate from live business records.

`lib/scenario-knowledge.ts` supplies the public material. `lib/prompt-context.ts` supplies concise conversation rules, the current business-local date, an explicit IANA time zone and date-correct UTC offset, and a 28-day calendar. Dates in that calendar are not availability. Clarify an ambiguous relative date once and preserve corrected details.

### Capability boundary

The Support Engineer role is a configured example, and candidate answers exist only in this conversation. No ATS, resume store, candidate profile or application record is connected. Do not request identity documents, age, family information, health information, secrets or customer credentials. Do not fabricate experience, infer protected characteristics, score hiring suitability, make an employment decision, save answers, schedule an interview or claim stage advancement. A spoken communication example does not certify writing ability or language proficiency.

## Token lifetime compatibility

Browser RTC/RTM tokens and server-side Agent/REST tokens use the shared ten-minute `TOKEN_LIFETIME_SECONDS` duration. Token builders take durations, not Unix expiry timestamps. Keep the App Certificate and ConvoAI-capable REST tokens on the server.

The Agent start/stop routes explicitly mint tokens with `ConvoAITokenBuilder.buildToken` and pass the supported SDK `authToken` / session `token` options. This avoids the `agora-agents` 2.14.0 / `agora-token` 2.0.7 positional-argument mismatch: the SDK helper otherwise treats publisher role `1` as a one-second token lifetime. Do not patch installed dependencies or add blanket overrides. `verify:api` exercises the real SDK serialization with intercepted network transport, decodes and verifies actual signed tokens, and checks a 600-second lifetime for browser, REST start, Agent RTC/RTM and REST stop tokens. Revisit the explicit-token compatibility path only after an upstream SDK correction passes this regression and live acceptance.

## Lint dependency security compatibility

The registry audit reports GHSA-g3hv-75wg-m249 in minimatch 10.2.6, including the latest typescript-estree 8.72.2 dependency range. A parent-scoped pnpm override selects minimatch 11.0.1 only for `@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree>minimatch`; it does not replace unrelated consumers. Node.js 24 satisfies its runtime requirement, and the caller uses the retained CommonJS `minimatch` function with `dot: true`. Recheck and remove this compatibility override when the upstream dependency range includes a patched version. Run the complete verification suite and an official-registry audit after lockfile updates.
